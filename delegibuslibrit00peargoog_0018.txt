An old oalr, which the friends meet with in their walk, brings up
Ι the subject of Marcus’s poem “ Marius.” Atticus inquiring it the incidents
narrated in it are true, the author demurs that 'such an inquiry should
be addressed rather to the historiari than to the poet: his friend presses
him to undertalre the task of writing history, allegmg that this branch ol
literature has been neglected by his countrymen; the early Roman
historians are briefly and contemptuously annumerated. Marcus pleads
want ol leisnre as an excuse lor not having attempted a subject so
absorbing; adding that he hopes that old age will set him free to attend
to this, as well as to matters ol higher import (ie. philosophy); at the
same time he will always be ready to 've his country-men the benefit ol
his experienceinjurisprudence. His earers beg that he will improve the
present opportunity for a discussionol this subject.
