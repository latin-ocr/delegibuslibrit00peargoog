Ecclesiastic-one of those obscure literatr', who are supposed
hythe sceptic to hove mauled or manufactured much oi
that ancient literature which time has spared. Both
theories however, have been almost unanimously rejected 3 ⁰

and ¹the work has been pronounced by Connoisseurs a '

genuine Ciceronian.

The date of the composition of the de Legibus, has been
the subjectos much controversy: from the fact that it is
nowhere mentioned by Cicero, even in those¹ passages,
where his other political or philosophical writings are

enumerated (e. g. de Divin. 11. i), and that there is no
allusion to it in the letters to Atticus, Chapman (de aetate
Czieronzh librorum de legibus, cantab. 1741.) and, more
recently‚ Peter have argued that it is os later date (i e.
709-71o). But this theory hasbeen set aside3 because χ
itis inconsistent with the idea that Pompeius and Cato ol

Utica are spoken of, in the de Legibus (1. §- 8., 111. tl. 22,
40.), as characters still upon the scene. Moreover, the
whole work breathes a spirit of hopefulness and energy,
altogether at variance with that pathetic alternation of
melancholy repining and philosophie resignation, which
one finds in the works and letters oi those latter days ; iu
which the bereaved father mourns that he has nothing
left, neither occupation to divert, nor domestic comfort
to relieve his melancholy reflections, (ad Diu. 1v. vi. a).
In fact, unless with Wyttenbach we sall back upon that
period (U. C. 704 fia), which elapsed between Cicero’s
return from Cilicia and the breaking out os the civil war,
a few months later: which, to say the least, is very
improbable ; as Cicero was all that time distracted at the
prospectos a conflict, which could only end in a despotism
(⁴⁴ dominatio ab utroque quaesita est? ad Aue. v111. xi. 2.):
we are compelled to agree with Turnebus, Zumpt and
‘others that the only date possible is U. C. 702-703.
