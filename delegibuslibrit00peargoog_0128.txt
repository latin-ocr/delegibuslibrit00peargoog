Μ. curatores. The hunctions ol the AEdiles are comprised under
these three heads: (1) general charge of the city; (2) regulationof the
market3 (3) superintendence of the public games3 of which the Iudi
Megalmser and Romani belonged to the Curule, while the plebeii
specially devolved on the Plebeian AEdiles. (Dict. Antiq. AEdiles).

amoenam Cicero calls the Quaestura ‘primus-gindus homris’
(Verr. 1. 4); but the Curule AEdileship was the first honos which gave
the ius imaginum (Verr. v. 14) ; and, as Bake says, adscenmris not
exactly synonymous with gradus r cp. our ‘step ’ and ‘step up.'

censores Their fonctions, Bake thinks, are stated with more
particularity, because this office had fallen into abeyance: suspended by
Sulla, from the cens of Perperna (U. C. 668.) till the first cons. of
{papeha (684.) it was subsequently curtailed by Clodius as Trib. Pleb.

Tim templa. Halm aller Bake. MSS. have urbisin impla. Feldh.
objecls that by leole, in the phrase ‘tecta ac templa,¹ private buildings are
meant, asopp. to public. The passage (Livy, XLII. 3.) which he quotes, ,
in support of his own conj. looa, would seem ratherio establish Huschke's
conj. urbis sarta teste templa. The contracts for public works appear to
have been let by the Censors; but the duty os supervision would seem to
have devolved upon the AEdiles and Quaestores, in their respective
departments (See Ramsay, R. Α .).

disoribunto. There isaal. distribuam, from which it wouldbe
difficult to distin 'hit in Mss, The difference oi meaning is slight.-
According to Haimiad Catil. 1. ιν. 9. ), the Latin writers said discribere
not describere, where the fundamental meaning was distribuere, dividere,
depom. The people are first to be arranged according to their re-
spective tribes, and afterwards to be divided according to property and
age, into classes and carturiae. Halm suspects that ex in is a conuption,
probably ol et in. (See Dict. Antiq. Comitia Centum).
