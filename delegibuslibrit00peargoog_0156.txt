Scipio, tamen ita libertatem istam largior populo, ut
auctoritate et valeant et utantur boni. Sic enim a me
recitata lex est de suffragiis: optimatibus nom, plebi λ5
libera sunto. Quae lex hanc sententiam continet, ut
omnes leges tollat, quae postea latae sunt, quae tegunt
omni ratione suffragium, ne quis inspiciat tabellam, ne ro-
get, ne appellet. Pontes etiam lex Maria fecit angustos.

optimatibus nota. i.e. the people are to vote as the please, but
'the optimates are to be permitted to know how they vote. his sounds to
us like a paradox3 but, looked at irom the Ciceronian stand point (θ. 34),
is rational enough. Cicero says truly that secret votiug is unnecessary,
where the laws effectually prevent ambitus (bribery, intimidation dra),
and in this agrees with Quintus ; but the liberty which he concedes is
avowedly a specious device for quieting the people and, at the same time,
securing the influence oi the optimates. (On the subject oi secret voting,
see Long, R. R. Vol 1. e viii). '

Tumeb. As the lex uaria (635.) was prior to the lex Oeelia (647. ), we
must suppose that Cicero reiers to the original institution oi the ballot:
pontes were the approaches to the septum or anile (See Ramsay, R. A.
s. a.); when these passages were narrow, one man would not be able to
see how another voted.

δ. 39. Quas ai opposita. Is these precautions (ne quis inspiciat,
&oi are interposed to prevent undue influence, as they are on the whole,
Marcus finds no fault3 but even supposing that the laws (de ambitu)
prove sufficient to prevent it (this deals with Q.'s view of the proper
remedy ξ. 34), he would still leave the people the bellot, as a lund of
assertion oi liberty, provided &c.—-s0 that there may be liberty (this
iancied ireedom of action) in that very arrangement, in which &e-It is
likely that the people ssessing this symbol oi pseudo-liberty, will (as
in Quintus’ example of t eiuda'cr'a) rest satisfied with it, and be willing in
other respects (reliqua voluntas) to yield to the influenoe (gratiae, atifi-
candi) oi the bani. Halm reads sin valuerint autum 1. ut ⁶ t
