his letter to Atticus (ad Attia. v, ii. 3.) ; where he contrasts
his own reluctance to undertake the responsibilities of a
province, with the ambitious eagemess of other men.

· If the work was begun at this period, it is easy
to account for its being left unfinished, as well as for the
absence of allusion to it, in the letters to Atticus3 since
Cicero must have been called away from this congenial
occupatiori to his unwelcome province; and, owing ἵ
probably to the fact that both friends were at Rome
together, there are no letters from Cicero to Atticus for the r
year 702. The subsequent revolution and complete change
in the state of affairs, added to the Author's avowed
reluctance (1. i. 9.) to resume a subject once laid aside,

' Allusion has already been made to the incomplete and

Legibus: ina measure, no doubt, the wear of tirne must
be held accountable; but it is more than probable that the

Cicero commenced a treatise on Jurisprudence: and Bake
sees further indications of incompleteness, not so much in
the non-fulfilment of promises to dicuss certain topics at
greater length, and in the frequent references to previous
explanations, for which we look in vain (e. g. 11. ξ. 34 111.
5. 40.)-because, in these cases, the passages referred to
