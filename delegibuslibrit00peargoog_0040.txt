principia repetis! atque ita, ut ego non modo ad illa
non properem, quae exspectabam a te de iure civili,
sed facile patiar te hunc diem vel totum in isto sermone
consumere: sunt enim haec maiora, quae aliorum causa 10

ab lle quorum The Stoics lilrened the mind of a man, athis birth,
to a tablet prepared for writing3 on this tablet impressions received
through the senses were inscribed From the comparison of a number of
these ‘sensible impressions' (φαντασίαι or veta), were formed ideas or
notibus. If these ‘notions’ resulted from a natural and involuntary
generalization‚ they were called indifferently tvenne or προλήψειοε if, on the
other hand, the operation was artificial and intentional they were called
ἔννοιαι only. Diog. L. (vll. 54) defines πρόληψις as an ἔννοια φυσικὴ
τῶν καθόλου ι’. a “a natural perception of those things which are
‘universal’ (in a number of φανοοσίοι).” The human reason (λάρος),
in virtue of which men are called ‘rational' beings (haverol), was, they
thought, completed from these natural ideas (ἐκτῶν προλήψεων συμπλη-
ροῦσθαι) about the fourteenth year. Plutarch, Flac. Phil. tv. 11.
(Ritter. Hist. Phil. ἕ. 399.).

intellegentia ' Feldhtlgel remarks that intellegentia is said generally
in this place, whereas in §- 26. intellegeeuiae is tobe understood par·
tr'crdarly of the several ‘notions’.

ἐς, 28-34 Marcus proceeds to show that nran’s nature has fitted
him for the practice of Justice, which is based not on conventional opinion
but on nature itself. This is manifest in the wonderful similarity and
uniformity among rnen, as evinced by their community of ideas,
language, reason (and therefore Jus. cp. ᾗ. 23.) and capability for virtue,
(i. e. the perfectibility of their nature), 'as well as by their su rising

cultivated by all ; since all would have recognised the intimate connection
and almost identil , which existed between themselves and their fellow·
men. Thus, in e association of one perfect and uncorrupted nature
(capreus) with its fellow, we should have found that, as in the maxim of
Pythagoras, each would have loved and been as ready to communicate

wlitth his neighbour as himself 3 since he would have recognised in him an
a er ego.
