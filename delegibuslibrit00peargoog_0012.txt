Those who ,seek 'such information, ‘are referred to the¹
learned disquisitions of Madvig, Bake and Feldhltgel.
Briefly‚ it may be stated that all MSS, irom which the text
of the de Legibus must be, determined, are supposed by
competent Critics to have been derived, froma mutilated
original or archetype, by two channels3 each oi which,¹ in
its successive transcripte, has diverged more and more from
the original. Thus we find two classes or families of
’ MSS, according as they may be attributed to one or other
oi these sources. ’

¹ The three MSS. to which Bake, Halm and Vahlen
have assigned the highest authority, and on which Halm

and Vahlen have based their text-are marked respec· Ι

'tivelyr A, B and C. fOf these, A and B belong to the
Vossian collection, preserved in the University Library at
Leyden3 and c-sometimes called Codex Heinsriznus, from
its former owner Nic. Heinsius-is also preserved at
’ Leyden, thh regard to the date of these MSS, experts
have assigned A to the 11th century, B to the 12th and
Ctothe 12 or 13th

Vahlen, who has recently examined A and B, remarks
that, while both have been corrected, the corrector
of Abas generally effaced the original reading3 while, in
the case oi B, the original reading is frequently still visible
through the corrections: hence Vahlen would give the
preference to 13, ¹

As will easily be' seen, from what has been said
respecting'the condition os MSS, all the labours oi the
Critics only tend to bring out more clearly the fragmentary
condition oi this treatise of Cicero's. Indeed, some have
gone so sar as to deny him ¹,its authorship ; while others,
with, Hillsemann, have iallen back upon the theory that
what remains is merely an abridgment oi some larger
work, handed down in this form by some worthy·
