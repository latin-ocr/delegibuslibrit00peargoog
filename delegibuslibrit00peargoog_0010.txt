PREFACE. ·

m

SOME years ago, having occasion to read the de Legibus
oi Cicero, with a class oi Students preparing ior Examina·
tion, the Editor was met with the inquiry-“ Do you know
of any Edition with English notes ?”

When one considers that this treatise introduces us,
more shortly than any other work oi Cicer0, to some
oi¹ the most important Religious‚ .Political and Philo·
sophical questions os that time, it is impossible to help¹

’ a feeling oi astonishment that it should have been suffered

to remain so long in thelimbo oi Latin notes3 which, so
far as the majority oi young readers are concemed,
present an unquestioned ΜΗΔΕΙΣ uiuum

“ It is encouraging to find that, in France, during
the past few months, at least three Editions oi Book 1,
with notes in the vemacular‚ have been announced. The

present Edition was undertaken in the hope that, by

- lightening the labour oi the English Student, it might,

in some degree, promote the study of 'a work which, while
rich in questions sor the Antiquary and the Scholar, is
calculated, is any other, by stimulating his curiosity and
sustaining his interest, to encourage the tyro to grapple'
with its difficulties.

In determining the text, it has been thought best-as
well ior the sake os uniformity as out oi respect ior the
high reputation, which Professor Halm deservedly enjoys
among English Scholars-to depart as little as possible
