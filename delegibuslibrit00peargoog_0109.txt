92 CICERO

ipsique minus ceperint, quarn omuibus heredibus relin-
quatur, sacris ne alligentur. In donatione hoc idem
secus interpretantur, et quod pater familias in eius
donatione, qui in ipsius potestate est, adprobavit, ratum

5 est: quod eo insciente sactum est, si id is non adprobat,
ratum non est 51. His propositis quaestiunculae
multae nascuntur, quas quis, qui intellegat, non, si ad
caput referat, per se ipse facile perspiciat? Veluti, si
minus quis cepisset, ne sacris alligaretur, ac post deeius

' 10 heredibus aliquis exegissetpro sua parte id, quod ab
eo, quoi ipse heres esset, praetermissum suisset, eaque
pecunia non minor esset lacta cum superiore exactione,
quam heredibus omnibus esset relicta, qui eam pecuniam
exegisset, solum sine coheredibus sacris alligari. Quin

repulia, collecta. In order to escape the linbility to which partitae might
have subjected the legatee (ἕ. 48); he was permitted, in case no such
provision was made in the will, himself to allow a deductiori (e. g. C.
numme] from his legacy ; thus reducing it to less than an equal share.

in eius donatione. Wyttenbach remarks that, although a person
in potestate patris was not competent to make a will; yet under certain
conditione, with the permission olbis father, he could make adunatio
mortis camsai he cites Gaius, pandect. xvm. i. ς xxxrx. v. (See Dict.
Antiq. patria potestas). The discrepancy appears to be that, in the case
of a testanuntum, the legatae is allowed a discretionary power of eluding
the obligation of the sacra, thus frustrating the intention of the testator;
which might be presumed from the absence of such a direction (ἕ. 53.
cavere naturiset). In the donatia on the contrary, the intention of the
paterfizmilras (who is the real donator, his permission being indispensable)
has tobecarriedout. ⁴
